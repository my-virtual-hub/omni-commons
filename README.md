# Omni Commons

The "omni-commons" module is dedicated to providing a common base and essential shared resources for the efficient functioning of different modules and components of the system. This module centralizes common functionalities, libraries, and utilities, facilitating code reuse and maintaining consistency throughout the project.

The inclusion of libraries and utility classes in "omni-commons" allows for a standardized approach to common tasks, such as string manipulation, date and time operations, and network interactions. This not only saves development time but also promotes cleaner and more efficient coding practices, reducing code duplication.

## Installation
